Broadband Cloaking Using Nano-Assembled Plasmonic Meta-Structures</h1>
<p><strong>Imran Khan</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction &amp; Motivation</h2>
<p>Plasmonic cloaking suppresses the optical scattering signature of an
object by engineering a shell whose induced response cancels the
object’s far-field scattering. In the visible and near‑infrared regime,
this relies on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs)<br />
</li>
<li>Phase-engineered destructive interference<br />
</li>
<li>Strong multiple scattering within nanoparticle ensembles</li>
</ul>
<p>A dielectric sphere exhibits Mie scattering, producing resonances
based on refractive index contrast, core size, and wavelength. The goal
of cloaking is to <strong>erase that optical fingerprint</strong>.</p>

<h3 >Why traditional cloaking
models fail</h3>
<p>Classical approaches such as Maxwell–Garnett effective medium theory
fail for:</p>
<ul>
<li>dense, multilayer NP shells<br />
</li>
<li>multiple scattering interactions<br />
</li>
<li>large core sizes (d ∼ λ)<br />
</li>
<li>size- and phase-dispersive AuNP optical responses</li>
</ul>
<p>This work solves these limitations using a <strong>hybrid MFS +
Foldy–Lax multiscale solver</strong> that accurately models:</p>
<ul>
<li>full-wave scattering from the core<br />
</li>
<li>multiple scattering between hundreds to thousands of AuNPs<br />
</li>
<li>shell–core interactions<br />
</li>
<li>realistic material response</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 >Physical
Principles Behind Plasmonic Cloaking</h2>
<h3 >Destructive Interference</h3>
<p>Let the core produce scattering, $ f_{core} $<br />
Let the shell produce scattering, $f_{shell}$</p>
<p>Cloaking requires:</p>

<p> $$ f_{total} = f_{core} + f_{shell} \approx 0$$
</p>
<p>This demands:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magnitude match</strong> — shell scattering must be
strong<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Phase opposition</strong> — induced polarization must be
anti-phase<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Broadband response</strong> — maintained over a spectral
window</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Why AuNP shells work</h3>
<p>The extinction spectrum of AuNPs has a broad FWHM around <strong>520
nm</strong>, enabling broadband cancellation between 400–600 nm. The
strong scattering and absorption of the AuNPs creates intense local
fields inside the shell, driving destructive interference with core
scattering.</p>

<div>
<h2 >Computational methods:</h2>
<p>This section briefly states the computational procedure for modeling
scattering cross-section of a plasmonic meta-structures .</p>
<ul>
<li>Interaction of the monochromatic light with the dielectric core was
computed using Methods of Fundamentals of Solutions(MFS).</li>
<li>Multiple scattering and absorption by the nanoparticles in the shell
and the core  was computed using generalized Foldy-Lax scattering theory
following a modification.</li>
<li>Total scattered power by the meta-strucutre was computed using the
Optical Theorem <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{t}=\frac{4\pi}{k_{0}}Im[f(\hat{o},\hat{i})]\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Modeling Assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Metallic nanopparticles in the shell are assumed as point
scatterer.</li>
<li>A point scatterer has isotropic scattering pattern.</li>
<li>Extinction properties of a point scatterer was attributed to a
parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, known as
strength parameter as well. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha =
[\frac{\sigma_{s}}{4\pi}-(\frac{k_{0}\sigma_{t}}{4\pi})]^{1/2}
+\frac{ik_{0}\sigma_{t}}{4\pi}\)]</span> 
<p>total cross-section of a point scatterer,
  <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{t} = \sigma_{s}+\sigma_{a}\)</span></p></li>
<li>The scattering (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{s}\)</span>) and
the absorption (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{a}\)</span>)
cross-sections were computed using Rayleigh Scatterig theory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Problem statement
and solution method</h2>
<p>A plane wave with wavelength <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> propagates in the <span
class="math inline">\(+\hat{z}\)</span> direction and is incident on a
structure consisting of a dielectric sphere with radius <span
class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> surrounded by <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> small, metal nanoparticles. The metal
nanoparticles may be situated at subwavelength distances away from the
surface of the dielectric sphere. Hence, the field scattered by this
structure is the result of strong multiple scattering interactions
between each and all of the components of the structure. In what
follows, we describe a method to compute the field scattered by this
structure. For simplicity, we describe the problem for scalar waves. In
particular, we use the method of fundamental solutions(<strong>MFS</strong>) to compute
scattering by the dielectric sphere and the <strong>Foldy-Lax</strong> equations to model
the multiple scattering by the point particles that surround the
sphere.</p>
<p>Suppose that the origin of a coordinate system lies at the center of
the dielectric sphere. We denote the interior domain by <span
class="math inline">\(D = \{ r &lt; a \}\)</span> and the exterior
domain by <span class="math inline">\(E = \{ r &gt; a \}\)</span>. The
spherical surface <span class="math inline">\(B = \{ r = a \}\)</span>
is interface between the interior and exterior. The wave field in the
interior is denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{int}}\)</span> and satisfies the
homogeneous reduced wave or Helmholtz equation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left( \nabla^{2} + k_{1}^{2} \right)
\psi^{\text{int}}
  = 0, \quad \text{in $D$},
  \]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(k_{1}\)</span> denoting the
wavenumber for the dielectric sphere. The wave field in the exterior is
denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{ext}}\)</span> and
satisfies <span class="math display">\[ \left( \nabla^{2} + k_{0}^{2}
\right) \psi^{\text{ext}}
  = -k_{0}^{2} \sum_{n = 1}^{N} V_{n} \psi^{\text{ext}}, \quad
  \text{in $E$}.\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(k_{0}\)</span> is the wavenumber
for the exterior and <span class="math inline">\(V_{n}\)</span>
corresponds to the scattering potential for the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th metal nanoparticle. We write <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{ext}}\)</span> as the sum</p>
<p>$ \psi^{\text{ext}} = \psi^{\text{inc}} + \psi^{s}$</p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{inc}}\)</span> denoting
the incident field satisfying <span class="math display">\[
  \left( \nabla^{2} + k_{0}^{2} \right) \psi^{\text{inc}}
  = 0, \quad \text{in $R^{3}$},\]</span></p>
<p>and <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{s}}\)</span> denoting the
scattered field satisfying <span class="math display">\[ \left(
\nabla^{2} + k_{0}^{2} \right) \psi^{\text{s}}
= -k_{0}^{2} \sum_{n = 1}^{N} V_{n} \psi^{\text{inc}} - k_{0}^{2}
\sum_{n = 1}^{N} V_{n} \psi^{\text{s}}, \quad \text{in $E$}.
\]</span></p>
<p>We must supplement the equations above with conditions on <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as well as radiation conditions. We
prescribe that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \psi^{\text{int}} = \psi^{\text{inc}} +
\psi^{\text{s}} \quad
  \text{on $B$}, \]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
\partial_{\nu} \psi^{\text{int}} = \partial_{\nu} \psi^{\text{inc}}
  + \partial_{\nu} \psi^{\text{s}} \quad \text{on $B$},
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{\nu}\)</span>
denoting the derivative along the normal on <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> pointing into <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Additionally, we require that <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{s}\)</span> satisfies the Sommerfeld
radiation condition. The differential equations supplemented by the
interface conditions, and the requirement that <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{s}}\)</span> satisfies the Sommerfeld
radiation condition constitute a complete mathematical description of
the problem.</p>
</div>
<section >
<h2>Interior field</h2>
<p>To compute the interior field, we make use of the Method of
Fundamental Solutions (MFS) which is also known as the Discrete Source
Method. This method relies on knowing Green's function, denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(G_{1}\)</span>, which satisfies \begin{equation}
\left( \nabla^{2} + k_{1}^{2} \right) G_{1} = -\delta(r - r'),
\end{equation} and the Sommerfeld radiation condition. It is given
explicitly by \begin{equation} G_{1}(r - r') = \frac{e^{\mathrm{i} k_{1}
| r - r '|}}{4 \pi | r - r' |}, \end{equation} which is a spherical wave
centered at <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;\)</span> propagating in
the whole space with wavenumber <span
class="math inline">\(k_{1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The key observation is that when <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;
\not\in D\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G_{1}\)</span> exactly
satisfies the differential equation for <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{int}}\)</span> since <span
class="math inline">\(\delta(r - r&#39;) = 0\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(r \in D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r&#39; \not\in D\)</span>. Because of this, we
consider a set of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> points <span
class="math inline">\(r_{j}^{\text{int}} \in E\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, M\)</span> and form the following
approximation, $$\psi^{\text{int}}(r) \sum_{j =1}^{M} c^{\text{int}}_{j} G_{1}(r - \rho^{\text{int}}_{j}),r \in D. $$
 This approximation is an exact solution of the differential equation for <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{int}}\)</span> for any set of points
<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{j}^{\text{int}} \in E\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, M\)</span>. It is an
approximation of the solution of this scattering problem because it does
not exactly satisfy the boundary conditions. Rather, we will require
that this approximation satisfies the boundary conditions only at a set
of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> points, which is called a
collocation method.</p>
<p>In practice, we would like to have these points uniformly sample the
interface <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to make the
approximation of the interface conditions as accurate as possible.
Suppose the set of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> points <span
class="math inline">\(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{j} \in B\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, B\)</span> uniformly sample (or
close to uniformly sample) the sphere of radius <span
class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span>. Then, we set 

$$\rho^{\text{int}}_{j} = \rho^{\text{bdy}}_{j} + \ell \nu_{j},
\quad j = 1, \cdots, M, $$
with 
<span
class="math inline">\(\nu_{j}\)</span> denoting the unit outward normal
at <span class="math inline">\(r_{j}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\ell &gt; 0\)</span> denoting a user-defined
length parameter which we typically set to be smaller than a
wavelength.</p>

<section>
<h2>Exterior field</h2>
<p>To approximate <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{ext}}\)</span>
we make use of Green's identity which essentially states that the
exterior field is given by a superposition of surface and volume
sources. Here, surface sources correspond to scattering by the
dielectric sphere and volume sources correspond to the <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> metal nanoparticles. In what follows,
we approximate the surface sources using the Method of Fundamental
Solutions and the volume sources using the self-consistent Foldy-Lax
scattering theory, which is a scalar wave theory closely related to what
is used in the Discrete Dipole Approximation.</p>
<p>In what follows, we represent <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{ext}}\)</span> as the following sum,
<span class="math display">\[\psi^{\text{ext}} = \psi^{\text{inc}} +
\underbrace{\psi^{B} + \sum_{n =
      1}^{N} \Psi_{n}}_{\psi^{\text{s}}}, \]</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{B}\)</span> denoting the "surface source"
field scattered by the dielectric sphere and <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{n}\)</span> denoting the "volume source"
field scattered by the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th metal
nanoparticle. We describe our approximations for each of these scattered
fields below.</p>
<h3 >Field scattered
by the dielectric sphere</h3>
<p>We use the Method of Fundamental solutions to compute the field
scattered by the dielectric sphere. Here, we use the Green's function
<span class="math inline">\(G_{0}\) satisfying $$ \left(
\nabla^{2} + k_{0}^{2} \right) G_{0} = -\delta(r - r'), $$ and the
Sommerfeld radiation condition, which is given explicitly by <span
class="math display">\[
  G_{0}(r - r&#39;) = \frac{e^{\mathrm{i} k_{0} | r - r&#39; |}}{4 \pi |
r -
    r&#39; |}.\]</span> Just as we have done for the interior field, we
introduce the set of M points, 
<p>\[\rho_{j}^{\text{ext}} = \rho^{\text{bdy}}_{j} - 
\ell \nu_{j},\quad j = 1, \cdots, M. \] </p>
 Note that because <span
class="math inline">\(\ell &gt; 0\)</span>, it follows that <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_{j}^{\text{ext}} \not\in E\)</span>.
Consequently, the approximation given by <span class="math display">
\[
  \psi^{B}(r) \cong \sum_{j = 1}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{ext}} G_{0}(r -
  \rho_{j}^{\text{ext}}) \]</span> is an exact solution of \[\left(
\nabla^{2} + k_{0}^{2} \right) \psi^{B} = 0, \quad r \in E.\] We use the
approximation given above to approximate the field scattered by the
dielectric sphere. Because this approximation is a superposition of
spherical waves, each of which satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation
condition, this approximation satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation
condition. Because this approximation exactly satisfies the equation
above and the Sommerfeld radiation condition, it is only the interface
conditions that make it an approximation rather than an exact
solution.</p>

<h3 >Field
scattered by the metal nanoparticles</h3>
<p>Let us denote the center of the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th metal nanoparticle by <span
class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span>. In what follows, we assume that
each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> metal nanoparticles
is small enough that we can account for its scattering properties by a
scattering coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{n}\)</span>,
which may depend on <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. It
follows that the field scattered by the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th metal nanoparticle is given by 
\[ \Psi_{n}(r) = \alpha_{n} G_{0}(r - R_{n}) \Psi_{E}(R_{n}),\] with <span
class="math inline">\(G_{0}\)</span> denoting the Green's function
defined above and <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{E}(R_{n})\)</span>
denoting the exciting field evaluated at <span
class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span>. Supposing that <span
class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha_{n}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n = 1, \cdots, N\)</span> are known, all that
remains to be determined is <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{E}(R_{n})\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n = 1, \cdots, N\)</span>.</p>
<p>To determine this exciting field, we use Foldy-Lax theory which we
describe below. Foldy-Lax theory is a self-consistent multiple
scattering theory. It is not an exact theory, but it does account for
infinitely many interactions between the metal nanoparticles, so it
provides a useful multiple scattering model. This theory is limited to
settings in which the metal nanoparticles are not too densely
distributed over the dielectric sphere so that these scattering elements
are statistically independent.</p>
<p>We model the field exciting the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th metal nanoparticle as the following
sum, <span class="math display">\[
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n}) = \psi^{\text{inc}}(R_{n}) + \psi^{B}(R_{n}) +
  \sum_{\substack{n&#39; = 1\\ n&#39; \neq n}}^{N} \sigma_{n&#39;}
G_{0}(R_{n} - R_{n&#39;})
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n&#39;}). \]</span> This equation gives the exciting field
at <span class="math inline">\(r_{n}\)</span> as the sum of the incident
field <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{\text{inc}}\)</span>, the field
scattered by the dielectric sphere <span
class="math inline">\(\psi^{B}\)</span>, and the fields scattered by all
of the other <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> metal
nanoparticles evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(r_{n}\)</span>.
By rearranging this equation and considering it for each and all <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> metal nanoparticles, we obtain the
<span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> linear system, <span
class="math display">
\[
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n}) - \sum_{\substack{n&#39; = 1\\ n&#39; \neq n}}^{N}
  \sigma_{n&#39;} G_{0}(R_{n} - R_{n&#39;}) \Psi_{E}(R_{n&#39;}) =
  \psi^{\text{inc}}(R_{n}) + \psi^{B}(R_{n}), \quad n = 1, \cdots, N.
\]</span> Upon solution of this linear system, we obtain <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{E}(r_{n})\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n = 1, \cdots, N\)</span>. This result can then be
used to evaluate <span class="math display">\[
  \Psi(r) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \alpha_{n} G_{0}(r - R_{n})
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n}), \quad r \in E.
\]</span> This field gives the field scattered by the entire set of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> metal nanoparticles. Because this
field is given as a superposition of Green's functions, each of which
satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition, it follows that <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation
condition.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Interface conditions</h3>
<p>At this point we have introduced approximations for the interior and
exterior fields. Both are exact solutions of the associated differential
equations and the exterior field satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation
condition. All that remains is to require that these fields satisfy
interface conditions given in Section 1.</p>
<p>Let us review what we have so far. The approximation of the interior
field is given by <span class="math display">\[
  \psi^{\text{int}}(r) \cong \sum_{j = 0}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{int}} G_{1}(r
-
  \rho_{j}^{\text{int}}) \quad r \in D.
\]</span> The approximation of the exterior field is given by <span
class="math display">\[
  \psi^{\text{ext}}(r) \cong \psi^{\text{inc}}(r) +
  \underbrace{\sum_{j = 1}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{ext}} G_{0}(r -
    \rho_{j}^{\text{ext}})}_{\psi^{B}} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \alpha_{n}
  G_{0}(r - R_{n}) \Psi_{E}(R_{n}), \quad r \in E,\]</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{E}(R_{n})\)</span> satisfying <span
class="math display">\[
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n}) - \sum_{\substack{n&#39; = 1\\ n&#39; \neq n}}^{N}
  \sigma_{n&#39;} G_{0}(R_{n} - R_{n&#39;}) \Psi_{E}(R_{n&#39;}) \]
  \[ =
  \psi^{\text{inc}}(R_{n}) + \sum_{j = 1}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{ext}}
  G_{0}(R_{n} - \rho_{j}^{\text{ext}}), \quad n = 1, \cdots, N.
\]</span> The quantities <span
class="math inline">\(c_{j}^{\text{int}}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, N\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c_{j}^{\text{ext}}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, N\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{E}(R_{n})\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n = 1, \cdots, N\)</span> are to be
determined.</p>
<p>By requiring that the interface condition for the fields is satisfied
exactly on the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> boundary points,
<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} \in B\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \cdots, M\)</span>, we find that
<p>\[
  \sum_{j = 0}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{int}} G_{1}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} -
\rho_{j}^{\text{int}}) - 
 \sum_{j = 1}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{ext}} G_{0}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} -
  \rho_{j}^{\text{ext}}) - \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \alpha_{n} \] 
  \[ G_{0}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} - R_{n}) \Psi_{E}(R_{n}) = \psi^{\text{inc}}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i}),\quad i = 1,\cdots, M. \]</p> 
  Similarly, by requiring that the interface
condition for the normal derivatives of the fields is satisfied exactly
on the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> boundary points, we find
that <p>
\[\sum_{j = 0}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{int}} \partial_{\nu} \\
  G_{1}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} -
  \rho_{j}^{\text{int}}) - \sum_{j = 1}^{M} c_{j}^{\text{ext}}
  \partial_{\nu} G_{0}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} - \rho_{j}^{\text{ext}})\]
  \[-\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \alpha_{n} \partial_{\nu} G_{0}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i} - R_{n}) 
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n})=\partial_{\nu} \psi^{\text{inc}}(\rho^{\text{bdy}}_{i}), \quad i = 1,
  \cdots, M.\]</p> Finally, by rearranging terms in this equation, we find that
<span class="math display">\[
  \Psi_{E}(R_{n}) - \sum_{\substack{n&#39; = 1\\ n&#39; \neq n}}^{N}
  \alpha_{n&#39;} G_{0}(R_{n} - R_{n&#39;}) \Psi_{E}(R_{n&#39;}) \]
  \[- \sum_{j = 1}^{M}
  c_{j}^{\text{ext}} G_{0}(R_{n} - \rho_{j}^{\text{ext}})=
  \psi^{\text{inc}}(R_{n}) , \quad n = 1, \cdots, N.\]</span> These three equations give <span
class="math inline">\(2MN\)</span> equations for the <span
class="math inline">\(2MN\)</span> unknowns, <span
class="math inline">\(c_{j}^{\text{int}}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c_{j}^{\text{ext}}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1, \cdots, M\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{E}(r_{n})\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n = 1, \cdots,
N\)</span>. These equations can be combined to form a <span
class="math inline">\(2MN \times 2MN\)</span> linear system that can be
solves using standard numerical linear algebra methods.</p>
<p>We now present the codes that computes the solution of this linear
system and uses that result to compute the field scattered by this
cloaking structure.</p>

equations from this section we get,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\psi^{s}(r) \sim \left[  \frac{1}{4\pi}
\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_{j}^{ext} e^{ik_{0}\hat{o}.r^{ext}_{j}} +
\sum_{n=1}^{N} \alpha_n e^{ik_{0}\hat{o}.r^{NP}_{n}}
\Psi_{E}(r_{n}^{NP})
\right]\frac{e^{ik_{0}R}}{R}, R&gt;&gt;1\]</span></p>
<p>By comparing this last equation with the second equation from
beginning of this section we find the scattering amplitude using our
method given as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\hat{o}, \hat{i}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}
\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_{j}^{ext} e^{ik_{0}\hat{o}.r^{ext}_{j}} +
\frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \alpha_n e^{ik_{0}\hat{o}.r^{NP}_{n}}
\Psi_{E}(r_{n}^{NP}) \]</span></p>
<p>According to the Optical Theorem of the forward scattering theorem,
we can compute the total cross-section of the scattering structure
through evaluation of ,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_{t} =
\frac{4\pi}{k_{0}}Im[f(\hat{i},\hat{i})]\]</span></p>
<p>Now we can compute the total cross-section by substituiting equation
above the last equation into this formula. Remarkably, the last equation
of this section allows for the determination of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{t}\)</span> by only measuring scattered
power in the forward direction.</p>
